    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Victor Novikov and I am a frontend developer. At least, I think
      what I am a frontend developer. A have been doing web development since 2011
      (PHP, JS, HTML and so on). This is my first personal blog about development
      and anything else I find time to write about. I currently work as a
      full-stack developer at a small company. I live in Russia, in a small city.
      In my free time, I draw in various styles (pencil, pixel art).

    <p>
      I am not really a professional developer, but my GF does not think so.
      I enjoy my work and learning everything new.
    </p>

    <p>
      Development is very important to me and I hope you enjoy reading my blog.
